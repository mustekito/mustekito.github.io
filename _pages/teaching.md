Most of my teaching experience has been at the School of Engineering (ETSE) at the University of Santiago de Compostela (USC), where I taught from 2017 to 2021 as an FPU predoctoral researcher and, since September 2023, as an Assistant Professor. From January to August 2023, I also taught at the Faculty of Computer Science at the University of A Coruña (UDC) as a Juan de la Cierva postdoctoral researcher.
