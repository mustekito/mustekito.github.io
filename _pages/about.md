I am an Assistant Professor at the [University of Santiago de Compostela](https://www.usc.gal), where I am a member of the [CiTIUS](https://citius.gal) research center. Before joining the USC, I was a postdoctoral researcher (Juan de la Cierva grant) at the [University of A Coruña](https://www.udc.gal). I obtained my PhD in Computer Science in 2021 from the USC under the supervision of Dra. Dora B. Heras and Dr. Francisco Argüello.

My research focuses on processing multi and hyperspectral remote sensing images using high-performance computing solutions. Specifically, I work on developing more accurate automatic registration algorithms by efficiently exploiting the spectral information available in these images. I am interested in creating parallel and distributed computing solutions to process these images in real-time using commodity hardware such as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) and multicore Central Processing Units (CPUs), as well as distributed systems like clusters.

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
