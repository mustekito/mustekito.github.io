I am an Assistant Professor at the [University of Santiago de Compostela](https://www.usc.gal), where I am a member of the [CiTIUS](https://citius.gal) research center. Before joining the USC, I was a postdoctoral researcher (Juan de la Cierva grant) at the [University of A Coruña](https://www.udc.gal). I obtained my PhD in Computer Science in 2021 from the USC under the supervision of Dra. Dora B. Heras and Dr. Francisco Argüello.

My research focuses on processing multi and hyperspectral remote sensing images using high-performance computing solutions. Specifically, I work on developing more accurate automatic registration algorithms by efficiently exploiting the spectral information available in these images. I am interested in creating parallel and distributed computing solutions to process these images in real-time using commodity hardware such as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) and multicore Central Processing Units (CPUs), as well as distributed systems like clusters.
